# Application_of_Benford_Law

This project is driven by an academic curiosity to explore the application and effectiveness of Benford's Law across diverse datasets. 

Benford's Law, also known as the Newcombâ€“Benford law or the law of anomalous numbers, suggests that in many real-life numerical datasets, smaller digits are more likely to appear as the leading digit. Typically, '1' appears as the leading digit about 30% of the time, while '9' appears less than 5% of the time. 

Commonly used as a preliminary check for inconsistencies in datasets, especially in financial records, Benford's Law can be applied using Python's dedicated library or through manual computation of Benford values for comparison with real data frequencies. In this study, I will apply both methods to scrutinize two distinct datasets: a company's financial statement and COVID-19 case numbers, the latter being an unconventional application for Benford's Law. 

It is important to note that this project is purely for scholarly exploration, as Benford's Law is not a definitive tool for confirming data accuracy or authenticity.
